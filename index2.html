            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Khalil Bryant and I am 30 years old. I am the oldest of 5 siblings and was born and raised in Stamford,CT by my aunt, Karen. After graduating highscool, I left CT for a couple of years and moved to Tampa,FL where I worked as a Help Desk Technician for a non-profit company that assisted families in need of shelter. While working there I also attended school to gain my Associates degree in Criminal Justice. However I soon realized I wanted to continue a lifelong dream and persue an education in the tech field.</p>

            <h1><em>Why become a Software Engineer?</em></h1>
            <p>My love for computers began at a very young age. I would take apart computers and try to figure out how they worked and then reassemble them. As I got older my love for technology grew, but I struggled in math and was told that an opportunity in tech wouldn't be possible. After landing my first job in tech as a Help Desk Technician, I decided I was going to give it another shot because I was good at it. I started doing my own research and realized that I love to build things and solve problems. I came accross Software Engineering and the first thing that came to mind was I would be able to build/create things for other users to use all while solving complex issues, and immediately I was sold into it.</p>
